# SiLabs Thunderboard Sense Firmware Source Code

This is the version used in the capacitive power transfer (CPT) project.
It has disabled the power source detection and forces the system to run in low-power mode.
You will need SiLabs' Simplicity Studio to build the project.

A separate version that can be directly built from standard gcc toolchain might be released in the future.
However, the resultant firmware would be different, despite with the same function.

For license, see each individual file.
